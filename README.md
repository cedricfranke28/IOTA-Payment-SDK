# IOTA-Payment-SDK by Cedric Franke

## Declaration

As part of my study work for the DHBW Mosbach, I should implement a payment process with an ESP32 development board and IOTA.
The ESP32-Client-SDK from oopsmonk served as the basis for the project. Thanks for the help and that I could use it as a base.
